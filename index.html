    <h1> Hi! This is Rebecca :) </h1>
    <p>I am a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems 
        and Human-Computer Interaction. I am interested in UX design, product design, 
        and product management. 
    </p>
    <p>Being a highly observant person, I always unconsciously care about and think 
        about the detailed design of things in my everyday life, from a small road 
        sign on the street to the interaction of a website. I found my career 
        interest in UX design and product design in my freshman year after trying 
        to design and build a website on my own. I was intrigued by how people benefit 
        from a user-friendly interaction design, and I feel passionate about designing 
        products and interactions that can make people's life more convenient. 
    </p>
